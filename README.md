# NYCDSA Machine Learning Project

In this Machine Learning Project, cohorts Yadi Yang, Stella Oliviera, and Mimi Chung make an attempt to accurately predict Iowa Housing prices as part of an entry to a Kaggle competition. This project was completed in Python, and the team achieved an accuracy of about 89%. Several methods of data cleaning and exploration, outlier search, and modeling were completed. Please refer to the PowerPoint presentation to see an overview of these methods.
